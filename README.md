This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Kotlin App](https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app).

## Use Dukat to generate type code
Currently Dukat is not mature. However, it is still useful to generate most of the useful type code. 

In this case, recharts type definition file is [here](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/recharts/index.d.ts)

However, there will a lot of compile error after generating. I have raised an [issue](https://github.com/Kotlin/dukat/issues/144) for Dukat.

recharts.module_data-vis.kt is the autogenerated file name. The dukat I used version is 0.0.21

## Create Ourselves' proxy type code based on autogenerated one.
I create a new one type file based on above auto one. Recharts.kt.

## Now we are ready for render
